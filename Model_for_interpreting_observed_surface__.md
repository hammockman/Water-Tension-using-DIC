  ### Model for interpreting observed surface strains

Surface strains develop during drying driven by at least 3 interacting processes:

* Thermal strains
* Shrinkage due to loss of cell wall moisture
* Contraction due to water tension.

J to add more maths – WT10.html has a good description, but I haven’t had any luck importing it from html into word.
