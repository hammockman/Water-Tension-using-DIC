During drying the following phases occur (see figure x):

    A Surface water evaporates. No water lost from interior water bodies. No water tension exists.
    B Water transported as liquid to evaporative front. Water bodies large. Water tension develops. Contraction
    C Water continues to be delivered to evaporative front and lost, but increasingly this transport starts to involve vapour as well as liquid transport. As tension develops, vapour seeding occurs (or maybe cavitation) and the water bodies break up into progressively smaller entities. Decontraction
    D Liquid water all gone. No water bodies left. Moisture loss now all via diffusive vapour transport. Cell-walls start to shrink as their moisture content drops below fibre saturation. Shrinkage
