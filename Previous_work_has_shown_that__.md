Previous work has shown that traditional wood quality characteristics (density, microfibril angle, etc) do not serve well as predictors of intraring check propensity \cite{nair09}. Yet IC&C is clearly a WQ issue (since it occurs only sporadically). Thus we need define new WQ measures and before doing so need to know if we principally seek factors controlling strength, micro-stress or load factors.
