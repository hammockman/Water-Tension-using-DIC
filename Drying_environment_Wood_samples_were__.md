### Drying environment

Wood samples were air dried under controlled-temperature conditions. The DIC system was housed in a small well ventilated room with a continuously run extractor fan. The room was heated by a domestic fan heater connected to an on/off PID controller to maintain ~27Â° C. Relative humidity and temperature in the room were logged at 5-minute intervals using an Extech RHT50 USB logger which records temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure. This remained connected to a computer during the experiment and the data downloaded from it periodically. During the experiment samples were placed on individual 1.2kg PT load cells (http://www.ptglobal.com/) and the load measured every 5 minutes and logged to a computer. At the end of the experiment the samples were oven dried, so that the moisture content of each board during the experiment could be calculated.
