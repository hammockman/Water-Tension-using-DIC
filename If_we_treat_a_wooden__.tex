If we treat a wooden sample as an infinite body (i.e. ignoring edge effects), composed of an orthotropic homogeneous hygroelastic material, with no intra-body gradients (i.e. a quasi-static process, only ever infinitesimally far away from equilibrium), subjected to an internal hydrostatic water-tension load, then the surface strains would be given by

εTεLγTL=(ST+STZ+STL)σ+ε∘T=(STL+SZL+SL)σ+ε∘L=0

If the material is much stiffer in the longitudinal direction than in any transverse direction then SL≈0
and STL≪ST+STZ

. Then, when the above becomes:

εTεL=(ST+STZ)σ+ε∘T=(STL+SZL)σ+ε∘L

Previously εT
and ST have been measured and σ estimated assuming STZ=0 [bookerXX]. Because εL is also related to σ it seemed worthwhile trying to use DIC to measure both it and εT in order to better understand the stress-strain state in the early stages of drying and to develop better estimates for σmax

(a wood quality measure that might potentially contribute to explaining why some material is susceptible to intra-ring checking during drying and other material is not).

In reality:

    edge effects are present,
    the material is not homogeneous,
    intra-body gradients in moisture content and water tension do exist,
    the surface strains are not measured exactly in the material principal directions,
    the material is not perfectly orthotropic,
