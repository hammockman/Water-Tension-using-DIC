### Model for interpreting observed surface strains

Surface strains develop during drying driven by at least 3 interacting processes:

* Thermal strains
* Shrinkage due to loss of cell wall moisture
* Contraction due to water tension.

J to add more maths – WT10.html has a good description, but I haven’t had any luck importing it from html into word.  


If we treat a wooden sample as an infinite body (i.e. ignoring edge effects), composed of an orthotropic homogeneous hygroelastic material, with no intra-body gradients (i.e. a quasi-static process, only ever infinitesimally far away from equilibrium), subjected to an internal hydrostatic water-tension load, then the surface strains would be given by
