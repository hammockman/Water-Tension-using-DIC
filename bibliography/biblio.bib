  abstract={Intra-ring checking (checking) is a wood quality defect that can develop sometimes in Pinus radiata D.Don (radiata pine) wood
during the drying process. The aim of this small study was to examine various mechanical properties of intra-ring-checked
wood to determine how they differed from non-checked wood. This would help understand which of these mechanical
properties (if any) might make wood susceptible to checking. Three mechanical properties of wood (density, microfi bril
angle (MFA) and modulus of elasticity (MOE)) were examined in oven-dried radiata pine disks that displayed different
degrees of checking. These measurements were made using SilviScan-2 equipment. Microfi bril angle was also examined
using X-ray diffraction (XRD) while MOE data was also obtained using a modifi ed version of a Fullam micro-test stage.
None of the data obtained for any of the mechanical properties showed signifi cant differences relative to checking.
However, some trends could be observed that helped draw some conclusions about the mechanical properties
observed in checked and non-checked wood. The checked wood samples had a lower density than the nonchecked
wood samples by SilviScan-2 analysis. When measured by XRD, the MFA of checked wood was higher
than that of non-checked wood. However, when measured by SilviScan-2, the MFA of checked wood and nonchecked
wood did not show such clear differences. There was also no signifi cant difference in the MOE of checked
and non-checked wood obtained by either SilviScan-2 or by Fullam micro-test stage equipment. In summary,
the three properties measured were insuffi cient predictors of checking in this small set of radiata pine samples.}

  abstract = {Intra-ring checking, and its effect on value recovery from clearwood products has produced significant industry interest. In recent years Wood Quality Initiative and Solid Wood Innovation have funded a large amount of research in the hope of uncovering specific causes and eventually eliminating it as a serious defect in radiata pine. Within-ring checking is specific type of internal checking. The checks are contained within single growth rings and not apparent on the surface, as distinct from surface checking which is clearly visible. It is only after the kiln drying process that these checks become visible. Depending on the severity of the defect, it can cause rejects, raw material losses and increased processing costs.},

  abstract = {A fast and accurate strain measurement method was developed to quantify microscopic deformation in wood and paper using video images. Two or more video images, one of which was undeformed and the others of which were deformed, were digitized and compared using the image correlation technique. This digital computer pattern recognition technique permitted the displacement of any point in the image to be measured. Then, strain between any two points in this observation field could be calculated and hence normal and shearing strains and Poisson's ratio could be measured directly. The technique was validated by comparison with other experimental strain measurement methods, and with an analytical model. The method can be applied at all scales since it is noncontact, and image based.},
