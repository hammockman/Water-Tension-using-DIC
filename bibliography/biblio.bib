  abstract      = {A fast and accurate strain measurement method was developed to quantify microscopic deformation in wood and paper using video images. Two or more video images, one of which was undeformed and the others of which were deformed, were digitized and compared using the image correlation technique. This digital computer pattern recognition technique permitted the displacement of any point in the image to be measured. Then, strain between any two points in this observation field could be calculated and hence normal and shearing strains and Poisson's ratio could be measured directly. The technique was validated by comparison with other experimental strain measurement methods, and with an analytical model. The method can be applied at all scales since it is noncontact, and image based.}
