### CT Scanning

For two DIC experiments, samples were prepared as above, and immediately prior to starting the DIC experiment (i.e. after the drying faces had been planed) the samples were x-ray CT scanned using a medical CT scanner (Siemens Somatom Spirit). The boards were analysed again following final oven drying, so the density profiles of the green wood, and the oven dried wood were compared. During scanning the boards were placed in a Perspex tray, surrounded by foam rubber to isolate the wood samples from each other, and from the plastic.

Something about how this was analysed.
