Previously εT and ST have been measured and σ estimated assuming STZ=0 [bookerXX]. Because εL is also related to σ it seemed worthwhile trying to use DIC to measure both it and εT in order to better understand the stress-strain state in the early stages of drying and to develop better estimates for σmax (a wood quality measure that might potentially contribute to explaining why some material is susceptible to intra-ring checking during drying and other material is not).
