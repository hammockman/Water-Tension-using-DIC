### DIC setup

A VIC-3D image correlation system from Correlated Solutions was used. The system utilised two 5.0 megapixel cameras with 17mm lenses. The cameras were positioned approximately 1.25m from the surface of the boards and set to an aperture of f-11 to give sufficient field of view to have the board surfaces (insert picture of set up). Diffuse, lighting was provided via a fluorescent ceiling light off set from the cameras, and lightproof curtains ensured that lighting levels remained the same during the day and at night. A shutter speed of 1000ms was used to give an appropriate exposure, so that no part of the image was overexposed. Prior to planing the wood samples and starting an experiment (see sample preparation below) the system was calibrated according to the manufacturers specifications, using a calibration grid (supplied) which was slightly larger than the total area of the boards being measured. As soon as the prepared samples were placed in the camera area, photographs were taken at five minute intervals. To maintain calibration over the long time periods required (200-600 hours) no-one was to enter the room while an experiment was running. The experiment was monitored via a remote connection to the DIC and loadcell computers.
