### Sample preparation
Wood was sourced from a local forest who supplied fresh (<24h post-felling) radiata pine logs ~1m long. These were milled in a Peterson circular swingblade portable mill to give two square sapwood boards with growth rings parallel to one sawn face (Figure ? - the sample board is about to be cut to the left of the saw cut). The boards were then cut to 45x45mm squares using a band saw, then docked to give two 220mm long samples from each board. The samples were wrapped tightly in plastic and were immediately sealed on all six sides with a two pot epoxy-based sealant (Carboguard 635). After around 48 hours curing, a coat of matt white paint was applied to one ‘quarter sawn’ surface (Face A in Figure 1.) on each sample board. Once the paint had dried, the speckle patterns were applied using the method described below. Then the two adjacent non-speckled ‘flat sawn’ surfaces (Face B, in Figure 1, and the face opposite) were planed to expose two drying faces. The boards were wrapped tightly in plastic, weighed individually, and then taken immediately to the DIC room to start the experiment. If an experiment was not able to be started immediately, the boards were submerged in deionised water and placed in a 4°C chiller until required. 
To produce boards free of water tension, one set of boards was kiln dried immediately after sawing, then was pressure resaturated with water prior to be painted and prepared using the same method as the boards above.
