### Speckle pattern

A random pattern was generated by Speckle Generator© (Correlated Solutions) and applied to a Grafix® Rub-onz transfer using a laser photocopier. This transfer was then stuck on the required sealed surface. Several speckle patterns were trialled by applying them to dried wood samples and photograping them using the DIC setup. These were then analysed using the usual VIC-3D parameters, and the speckle pattern with the consistently lowest sigma (error) value was chosen. This had the following Speckle Generator© settings: Radius: 0.02, Coverage: 75, Variation: 0.9. Three distinct A4-sized master speckle patterns were generated and these were photocopied onto the transfer film. When two sheets of transfer film were used in the same experiment, these were taken from different master patterns, to ensure the same speckle did not appear twice in any experiment.
