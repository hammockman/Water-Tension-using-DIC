## Introduction

It has long been realized that water tension arises in the liquid body early in drying (Tiemann, 1915). This hydrostatic negative pressure can cause collapse and intraring checking (also known as within-ring checking or internal checking) which occur if the material is not strong enough to withstand the stresses generated in the woody substance. A good description of how water tension creates collapse and intraring checking can be found in Booker (1994). 

Because specific conditions are required to create intraring checks – a combination of weak cell walls (caused by genetics, or conditions during tree growth), and high water tension (Booker, 1994), simply counting the number of checks formed makes it difficult to disentangle the various factors contributing to it. Also, even very low incidences of checking have a major economic impact on producers. For New Zealand radiata pine, checking affecting more than 5% of boards is considered unacceptable. Scientific studies trying to quantify such isolated occurrences via counting internal checks require very large sample sizes to see effects.   

Degrade caused by intraring checking is a major cost to the wood processing industry (Putoczki, et al., 2007). Efforts to reduce internal checking has mainly focused on altering drying conditions (Cown, 2013), which has only been partially successful in reducing the problem. Other potential ways to reduce intraring checking are to breed trees with less susceptibility - as suggested by Kumar, et al. (2010), or to pretreat to reduce the maximum water tension developed. In order to do this work, a qualitative measurement of the degree of check susceptibility is needed, not simply a measure of whether a check has occurred. Water tension is a prime candidate for this, but because the water is in a meta-stable state, attempts to measure it directly will destroy the water tension force. An indirect measurement technique is required. Booker, et al. (2003) developed a technique for inferring water tension based on measuring transverse surface contraction strains. Transverse (tangential/radial) strains have the advantage of being large, so are easier to measure accurately, but the disadvantage of being complicated by poissons effects etc., so the results are more difficult to interpret. Booker, et al. (2003) observed transverse shrinkage beginning almost immediately as the wood started drying, despite the wood being well above fibre saturation, where shrinkage due to the loss of bound water begins. This shrinkage reached a maximum at around 50-60% MC, then there was a period of ‘decontraction’ where the dimensions increased for a time. From there, the wood started shrinking again, and continued to shrink until dry, as would be expected. This initial shrinkage and decontraction is thought to be due to the increase in water tension early in drying, followed by the release in tension as the connected water body breaks up. 

Later commercial studies by WQI using this technique indicated a 5-fold variation in surface strains between different wood samples (Harrington, et al., 2007). This study also raised concerns about the accuracy of this technique, as there was a lot of scope for transcription errors during measurement, and for disturbing the measurement pins embedded in the wood surface. It was noted that if a more precise, automated method was found for measuring surface strains, this would give better results, and potentially simplify analysis by enabling longitudinal strains to be measured. 

Digital image correlation (DIC) (Schreier, et al., 2009) has been used previously to measure shrinkage in wood (Larsen, et al., 2013), so is a good candidate for measuring the surface strains caused by water tension. Because the measurements only require photographs to be taken of the samples, they are non-contact and can be automated, measurements can be made frequently around the clock, which lowers the risk of missing measurements around key times, such as the expected decontraction point. Here a DIC method has been developed to quantify water tension in radiata pine by measuring surfaces strains. 



## Methodology

### Sample preparation
Wood was sourced from a local forest who supplied fresh (<24h post-felling) radiata pine logs ~1m long. These were milled in a Peterson circular swingblade portable mill to give two square sapwood boards with growth rings parallel to one sawn face (Rosie to insert picture of mill). The boards were then cut to 45x45mm squares using a band saw, then docked to give two 220mm long samples from each board. The samples were wrapped tightly in plastic and were immediately sealed on all six sides with a two pot epoxy-based sealant (Carboguard 635). After around 48 hours curing, a coat of matt white paint was applied to one ‘quarter sawn’ surface (Face A in Figure 1.) on each sample board. Once the paint had dried, the speckle patterns were applied using the method described below. Then the two adjacent non-speckled ‘flat sawn’ surfaces (Face B, in Figure 1, and the face opposite) were planed to expose two drying faces. The boards were wrapped tightly in plastic, weighed individually, and then taken immediately to the DIC room to start the experiment. If an experiment was not able to be started immediately, the boards were submerged in deionised water and placed in a 4°C chiller until required. 
To produce boards free of water tension, one set of boards was kiln dried immediately after sawing, then was pressure resaturated with water prior to be painted and prepared using the same method as the boards above.

### Speckle pattern

A random pattern was generated by Speckle Generator© (Correlated Solutions) and applied to a Grafix® Rub-onz transfer using a laser photocopier. This transfer was then stuck on the required sealed surface. Several speckle patterns were trialled by applying them to dried wood samples and photograping them using the DIC setup. These were then analysed using the usual VIC-3D parameters, and the speckle pattern with the consistently lowest sigma (error) value was chosen. This had the following Speckle Generator© settings: Radius: 0.02, Coverage: 75, Variation: 0.9. Three distinct A4-sized master speckle patterns were generated and these were photocopied onto the transfer film. When two sheets of transfer film were used in the same experiment, these were taken from different master patterns, to ensure the same speckle did not appear twice in any experiment.   

### Drying environment

Wood samples were air dried under controlled-temperature conditions. The DIC system was housed in a small well ventilated room with a continuously run extractor fan. The room was heated by a domestic fan heater connected to an on/off PID controller to maintain ~27° C. Relative humidity and temperature in the room were logged at 5-minute intervals using an Extech RHT50 USB logger which records temperature, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure. This remained connected to a computer during the experiment and the data downloaded from it periodically. During the experiment samples were placed on individual 1.2kg PT load cells (http://www.ptglobal.com/) and the load measured every 5 minutes and logged to a computer. At the end of the experiment the samples were oven dried, so that the moisture content of each board during the experiment could be calculated. 

### DIC setup

A VIC-3D image correlation system from Correlated Solutions was used. The system utilised two 5.0 megapixel cameras with 17mm lenses. The cameras were positioned approximately 1.25m from the surface of the boards and set to an aperture of f-11 to give sufficient field of view to have the board surfaces (insert picture of set up). Diffuse, lighting was provided via a fluorescent ceiling light off set from the cameras, and lightproof curtains ensured that lighting levels remained the same during the day and at night. A shutter speed of 1000ms was used to give an appropriate exposure, so that no part of the image was overexposed. Prior to planing the wood samples and starting an experiment (see sample preparation below) the system was calibrated according to the manufacturers specifications, using a calibration grid (supplied) which was slightly larger than the total area of the boards being measured. As soon as the prepared samples were placed in the camera area, photographs were taken at five minute intervals. To maintain calibration over the long time periods required (200-600 hours) no-one was to enter the room while an experiment was running. The experiment was monitored via a remote connection to the DIC and loadcell computers. 

### CT Scanning

For two DIC experiments, samples were prepared as above, and immediately prior to starting the DIC experiment (i.e. after the drying faces had been planed) the samples were x-ray CT scanned using a medical CT scanner (Siemens Somatom Spirit). The boards were analysed again following final oven drying, so the density profiles of the green wood, and the oven dried wood were compared. During scanning the boards were placed in a Perspex tray, surrounded by foam rubber to isolate the wood samples from each other, and from the plastic.

Something about how this was analysed.  

### Model for interpreting observed surface strains

Surface strains develop during drying driven by at least 3 interacting processes:

* Thermal strains
* Shrinkage due to loss of cell wall moisture
* Contraction due to water tension.

J to add more maths – WT10.html has a good description, but I haven’t had any luck importing it from html into word.  




## Results and Discussion


## Conclusions

Digital Image Correlation has been shown to be capable of measuring longitudinal surface strains during drying. Contraction maxima attributable to water tension can be observed. 
Comment on (lack of) variability of strains (compared to WQI report). 

Future work will use the DIC technique described above to investigate:

* Characterise water tension development in a collapse-prone wood species. 
* How micro-anatomical features  (e.g. ray-tracheid pit field architectures) influence maximum water tension that can be developed
* Effectiveness of pre-treatments in reducing maximum water tensions
* Correlations between water tension assessment and existing IC resource characterization protocols (oven-dry disc method, core collapse method)
