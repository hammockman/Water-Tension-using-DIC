It has long been realized that water tension arises in the liquid body early in drying \cite{tiemann15}. In softwoods, this hydrostatic negative pressure can cause collapse and intraring checking (also known as within-ring checking or internal checking) if the material is not strong enough to withstand the stresses generated in the woody substance. A good description of how water tension creates collapse and intraring checking can be found in \citet{booker94}. 

Because specific conditions are required to create intraring checks – a combination of weak cell walls (caused by genetics, or conditions during tree growth), and high water tension (Booker, 1994), simply counting the number of checks formed makes it difficult to disentangle the various factors contributing to it. Also, even very low incidences of checking have a major economic impact on producers. For New Zealand radiata pine, checking affecting more than 5% of boards is considered unacceptable. Scientific studies trying to quantify such isolated occurrences via counting internal checks require very large sample sizes to see effects.   

Degrade caused by intraring checking is a major cost to the wood processing industry (Putoczki, et al., 2007). Efforts to reduce internal checking has mainly focused on altering drying conditions (Cown, 2013), which has only been partially successful in reducing the problem. Other potential ways to reduce intraring checking are to breed trees with less susceptibility - as suggested by Kumar, et al. (2010), or to pretreat to reduce the maximum water tension developed. In order to do this work, a qualitative measurement of the degree of check susceptibility is needed, not simply a measure of whether a check has occurred. Water tension is a prime candidate for this, but because the water is in a meta-stable state, attempts to measure it directly will destroy the water tension force. An indirect measurement technique is required. \citet{booker03} developed a technique for inferring water tension based on measuring transverse surface contraction strains. Transverse (tangential/radial) strains have the advantage of being large, so are easier to measure accurately, but the disadvantage of being complicated by poissons effects etc., so the results are more difficult to interpret. \citet{booker03} observed transverse shrinkage beginning almost immediately as the wood started drying, despite the wood being well above fibre saturation, where shrinkage due to the loss of bound water begins. This shrinkage reached a maximum at around 50-60% MC, then there was a period of ‘decontraction’ where the dimensions increased for a time. From there, the wood started shrinking again, and continued to shrink until dry, as would be expected. This initial shrinkage and decontraction is thought to be due to the increase in water tension early in drying, followed by the release in tension as the connected water body breaks up. 

Later commercial studies by WQI using this technique indicated a 5-fold variation in surface strains between different wood samples (Harrington, et al., 2007). This study also raised concerns about the accuracy of this technique, as there was a lot of scope for transcription errors during measurement, and for disturbing the measurement pins embedded in the wood surface. It was noted that if a more precise, automated method was found for measuring surface strains, this would give better results, and potentially simplify analysis by enabling longitudinal strains to be measured. 

Digital image correlation (DIC) (Schreier, et al., 2009) has been used previously to measure shrinkage in wood \cite{kwon10,peng11,derome13,larsen13}, so is a good candidate for measuring the surface strains caused by water tension. Because the measurements only require photographs to be taken of the samples, they are non-contact and can be automated, measurements can be made frequently around the clock, which lowers the risk of missing measurements around key times, such as the expected decontraction point. Here a DIC method has been developed to quantify water tension in radiata pine by measuring surfaces strains.
