## Conclusions

Digital Image Correlation has been shown to be capable of measuring longitudinal surface strains during drying. Contraction maxima attributable to water tension can be observed. 
Comment on (lack of) variability of strains (compared to WQI report). 

Future work will use the DIC technique described above to investigate:

* Characterise water tension development in a collapse-prone wood species. 
* How micro-anatomical features  (e.g. ray-tracheid pit field architectures) influence maximum water tension that can be developed
* Effectiveness of pre-treatments in reducing maximum water tensions
* Correlations between water tension assessment and existing IC resource characterization protocols (oven-dry disc method, core collapse method)
