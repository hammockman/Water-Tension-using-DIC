Collapse and intraring checks are caused by water tension arising early in drying and this creates issues for wood processors in New Zealand. Previous work has indicated that the magnitude of the water tensions developed within Pinus radiata boards vary significantly. It is believed that this variation has its origins in the wood microstructure and is thus able to be influenced by genetic selection and silvicultural practices. 

Current methods for estimating the magnitude of water tension development are time consuming and of limited accuracy. Cheaper and more accurate techniques are required if the influence, via water tension, of genotype, silviculture and post-harvest treatment on intraring check occurrence are to be understood.

This paper presents work that

* Evaluates DIC as a method for measuring surface strains during drying,
* Quantitatively relate observed surface strains to the mechanical processes taking place.

**Key words**: Digital Image Correlation, water tension, wood drying, intra-ring checking
